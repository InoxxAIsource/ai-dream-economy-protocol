# Dream Economy Reward Pool Setup

## Current Issue
- Users own the DREAM tokens (1 billion pre-minted)
- Transferring tokens to yourself doesn't increase balance
- Need proper reward distribution mechanism

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Reward Pool Contract (Recommended)
Deploy a separate contract that:
- Holds a pool of DREAM tokens for rewards
- Allows platform to distribute rewards to users
- Tracks earned vs claimed rewards
- Prevents double-claiming

### Option 2: Multi-Signature Reward Wallet
- Create a dedicated wallet for reward distribution
- Pre-fund with DREAM tokens for distribution
- Platform controls distribution to users
- Simple but requires manual token management

### Option 3: Minting Permissions
- Modify DREAM token contract to allow platform minting
- Create new tokens as rewards (inflationary model)
- Most flexible but requires contract upgrade

## Current Implementation
- Tracks earned rewards in database
- Simulates blockchain transactions for testing
- Ready for production reward pool integration

## BSC Testnet Contracts
- DREAM Token: 0xe04879E0Dbf549567F535c7EB9d997A2769119cF
- User Wallet: 0x73eB1835929244710D4b894b147C4187dB80Aab7
- Current Balance: 1,000,000,000 DREAM tokens

## Next Steps
1. Deploy reward pool contract OR
2. Create dedicated reward wallet with token allocation OR  
3. Implement off-chain reward tracking with periodic settlements

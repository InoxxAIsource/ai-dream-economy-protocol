# How to Find Shell/Terminal in Replit

## Look for these locations:

### 1. Bottom Panel (Most Common)
- Look at the very bottom of your Replit screen
- You should see tabs like: "Console", "Shell", or a terminal icon (looks like >_)
- Click on the "Shell" or "Console" tab

### 2. Left Sidebar
- Check the left side menu
- Look for icons that look like a terminal or command prompt
- Might be labeled "Shell", "Terminal", or "Console"

### 3. Tools Menu
- Click on "Tools" in the top menu bar
- Look for "Shell" or "Console" option

### 4. Plus Button
- Look for a "+" button near tabs
- Click it and select "Shell" or "Terminal"

### 5. Keyboard Shortcut
- Try pressing: Ctrl + ` (backtick key, usually above Tab)
- This often opens the terminal

## What to Look For:
- A black or dark window
- Text that shows something like: `~/workspace$` or similar
- A cursor where you can type commands

## Once You Find It:
Just type or paste this single command:
```
bash deploy-to-github.sh
```
